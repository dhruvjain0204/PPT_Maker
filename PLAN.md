# PPT Question Automation - Master Plan

This document contains the overall plan and status of the PPT Question Automation project. It's updated whenever code or plans change.

## Project Overview

Automate the creation of practice question PowerPoint presentations from PDF sources. The system extracts questions from PDFs using LLM, applies template styling, and generates formatted PPTX files.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
python generate_ppt_from_pdf.py "Your-PDF-File.pdf"
```

This single command runs all three steps automatically and outputs to `PPTs/{PDF-name}.pptx`

## Development Approach

We're building this **step-by-step**, testing each part before moving to the next:
1. Each step runs independently
2. Saves output for review
3. Shows what was extracted/processed
4. Waits for verification before next step

This ensures we catch issues early and fix them before moving forward.

## Step 1: PDF Content Extraction ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `step1_pdf_extraction.py`

**Status:** ✅ Working - Uses Claude API to extract text from PDF

**What it does:**
- Extracts text content from PDF using Claude API (similar to Perplexity workflow)
- Supports both text-based and image-based PDFs (no OCR setup needed)
- Saves extracted text for manual review
- Analyzes content quality (questions, answers, options)
- Verifies extraction completeness

**How it works:**
1. Accepts PDF filename as command line argument (or uses default)
2. Extracts PDF name (without extension) for naming outputs
3. Loads PDF file and converts to base64
4. Sends PDF to Claude API with extraction prompt
5. Receives extracted text content
6. Analyzes content for quality indicators
7. Saves to `output/extracted_pdf_content_{pdf_name}.txt`
8. Saves PDF name to `output/current_pdf_name.txt` for next steps

**Dependencies:**
- `anthropic` - Claude API client
- `pyyaml` - Config file parsing
- `base64` - PDF encoding (built-in)

**To run:**
```bash
python step1_pdf_extraction.py "Adobe-Scan-03-Nov-2025.pdf"
# Or without argument (uses default PDF)
python step1_pdf_extraction.py
```

**Output:**
- `output/extracted_pdf_content_{pdf_name}.txt` - Full extracted text for review
- `output/current_pdf_name.txt` - PDF name for next steps

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Is the text readable and complete?
- [ ] Are questions properly extracted?
- [ ] Are options/answers included (if applicable)?
- [ ] Are tables/diagrams mentioned or described?
- [ ] Is the content in the correct order?
- [ ] Is the extraction accurate (no missing or incorrect content)?

**Next:** Once verified, proceed to Step 2: Question Parsing

---

## Step 2: Question Parsing & Slide Structuring ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `step2_question_parsing.py`

**Status:** ✅ Working - Parses extracted content into structured slide-ready objects

**What it does:**
- Parses extracted PDF content into structured question objects
- Extracts individual questions, options, answers, tables, diagrams
- Numbers questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3...) ignoring PDF numbers
- Handles multi-part questions (keeps all parts together)
- Detects passage-based questions (passage on separate slide)
- Structures tables with headers and rows
- Flags diagrams with [description] for manual addition later
- Organizes content into slide-ready format

**How it works:**
1. Reads PDF name from Step 1 (`output/current_pdf_name.txt`)
2. Loads extracted content from Step 1 (`output/extracted_pdf_content_{pdf_name}.txt`)
3. Sends to Claude API with structured parsing instructions
4. Receives JSON with question objects
5. Validates structure and counts statistics
6. Saves to `output/parsed_questions_{pdf_name}.json`
7. Creates human-readable preview

**Dependencies:**
- `anthropic` - Claude API client
- `pyyaml` - Config file parsing
- `json` - JSON parsing (built-in)

**To run:**
```bash
python step2_question_parsing.py
```

**Output:**
- `output/parsed_questions_{pdf_name}.json` - Structured JSON with all questions
- `output/parsed_questions_{pdf_name}_preview.txt` - Human-readable preview

**Slide Organization Rules:**
- Regular question: Question slide → Answer slide (if answer exists)
- Multi-part question: All parts on one question slide → Answer slide
- Multiple choice: Question + options → Answer slide
- Passage-based: Passage slide → Question slide(s) → Answer slide(s)
- Tables: Structured data with headers and rows
- Diagrams: Flagged as [description] for manual addition

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Are all questions properly parsed?
- [ ] Are multi-part questions kept together?
- [ ] Are passage-based questions detected correctly?
- [ ] Are tables structured correctly?
- [ ] Are diagram descriptions in brackets [description]?
- [ ] Are answers on separate slides after questions?

**Next:** Once verified, proceed to Step 3: Template Analysis

---

## Step 3: PPTX Generation (New Implementation) ✅ COMPLETE & REFINED

**File:** `step3_pptx_new.py`

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Generates PPTX optimized for Canva import with proper formatting

**What it does:**
- Reads parsed questions from Step 2
- Creates PowerPoint slides with professional formatting
- Uses Frankfurter Medium font (as per requirements)
- Positions text boxes to match Canva template dimensions exactly
- Renders tables intelligently (detects if table is just options, shows only options as text)
- Formats question/answer numbers with single dot (Q1., Ans1.)
- Shows simplified diagram notes as [Diagram]
- Handles multiple choice options without bullets

**How it works:**
1. Reads PDF name from Step 1 (`output/current_pdf_name.txt`)
2. Loads parsed questions JSON from Step 2 (`output/parsed_questions_{pdf_name}.json`)
3. Creates blank PowerPoint presentation with widescreen dimensions (13.333" × 7.5")
4. For each slide:
   - Question slides: Q1. [question] + options (no bullets) + table (if not options) + [Diagram]
   - Answer slides: Ans1. [answer]
   - Passage slides: [passage text]
5. Applies unified formatting (25pt font = 38pt in Canva, Frankfurter Medium, left-aligned)
6. Saves PPTX file to `PPTs/{pdf_name}.pptx` (with auto-numbering if file exists)

**Dependencies:**
- `python-pptx` - PowerPoint generation
- `json` - JSON parsing (built-in)

**To run:**
```bash
# With answer slides (default)
python step3_pptx_new.py

# Without answer slides
python step3_pptx_new.py --no-answers
```

**Output:**
- `PPTs/{pdf_name}.pptx` - PPTX file ready to import into Canva
- If file exists, automatically creates `PPTs/{pdf_name}_1.pptx`, `PPTs/{pdf_name}_2.pptx`, etc.

**Font & Formatting:**
- Font: **Frankfurter Medium** (as per requirements)
- Font size: **25pt** in PowerPoint (results in **38pt** in Canva for all slides)
- Font size: **18pt for tables** (increased for better readability)
- Alignment: Left-aligned
- Question/Answer numbers: Bold with single dot (Q1., Ans1., etc.)

**Text Box Positioning (Canva-Optimized):**
- Dimensions matched to Canva template exactly
- Position: X=73.6px, Y=162.3px (in Canva)
- Size: Width=1773.3px, Height=510.7px (in Canva)
- Uses correction factors to account for PowerPoint-to-Canva conversion differences

**Slide Dimensions:**
- Standard PowerPoint widescreen: 13.333" × 7.5" (16:9 aspect ratio)

**Smart Features:**
- **Options Table Detection**: If a table represents multiple choice options, shows only options as text (no duplicate table)
- **Diagram Simplification**: Shows only "[Diagram]" instead of full description to save space
- **No Bullets for Options**: Multiple choice options displayed without bullets
- **Single Dot Formatting**: Question/answer numbers have exactly one dot (Q1., not Q1..)
- **Optional Answer Slides**: Use `--no-answers` flag to exclude answer slides from the presentation

**Verification checklist:**
- [x] All questions present
- [x] Font is Frankfurter Medium
- [x] Font size is 38pt in Canva (25pt in PowerPoint)
- [x] Table font size is 18pt (increased for better readability)
- [x] Text box dimensions match Canva template
- [x] Tables render correctly (or skipped if they're options)
- [x] Answer slides numbered correctly (Ans1, Ans2...)
- [x] Options don't have bullets
- [x] Diagram shows as [Diagram] only
- [x] Single dot after Q/Ans numbers
- [x] Can import into Canva successfully
- [x] Optional answer slides feature works with --no-answers flag

**Next:** Import PPTX into Canva - dimensions and formatting are already optimized!

## Code Documentation Approach

**Inline Comments:** All code files have detailed inline comments explaining what each line/block does. This makes the code self-documenting and easier to maintain.

**No separate documentation files:** Instead of separate MD files explaining code, we use inline comments directly in the code files.
